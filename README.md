# Basic_Stock_Visulization_using_yfinance
**This project is a very basic stock price visualizer using yfinance and streamlit API**


This is a GUI based project of stock visualizer here we will use the above two modules and then we will use the naming convention of stocks so that yfinance can pull the
data from its server then we will use streamlit which will host a local server so that it is visible on your browser itself


**Making it work**

Please use cmd or terminal to run this code and just check if the libraries are pre-installed 

in cmd or terminal go to the location of the .py file on your machine then try using the command **streamlit run stocks1.py** then it will give a link of the server
which is hosted locally then you can have a gui representation of the server
